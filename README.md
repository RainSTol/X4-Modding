# X4-Modding
Repository for X4 mods created or tweaked by me.

## X4 Salvage (Obsolete)
  Adds Salvage, Recycle and Repair to X4.  Original concept was independent, however once discovered, outcome was greatly influenced by (X:R A New Frontier Mod https://www.egosoft.com:8444/confluence/display/XRWIKI/Mod%3A+New+Frontier)

Update this was being built before salvage was a thing.

## X4 Anomaly Generator
   Originial Idea's credit goes to Euclid's "PlayerJump" mod. https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/93
   Wanted to add Lore based feature to the game, with research and use costs, vs the "cheat" feel of the original implementation.

## X4 College Deployables
  This commands your ship to collect all Deployable items in sector that it is capable of collecting (everyone's).  Hack the items to claim them.
