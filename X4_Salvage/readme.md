Todo Items:
 - Write Salvage Command (great starting point from X:R A New Frontier)
 - Add Salvage Command to menu
 - Add new drones? or require L/XL ships?
 - How to treat Xenon wrecks?
 - What about all the in game wrecks you find on map?  Aquaduct for example, or all the debris in the astroid fields?  Part of map, or salvagable?
